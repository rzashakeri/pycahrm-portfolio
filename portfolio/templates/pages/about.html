      <h1 class="about-title">Hi, My Name Is Reza Shakeri ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p class="about-description">
        My name is Reza Shakeri, and I began coding when I was 13 years old. In the same year, I started a blog about
        animals called <a href="https://animalsiran.mianblog.com">animalsiran.mianblog.com</a>. There, I became
        acquainted with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>, and I customization of this blog. This was not
        the end of the story, since at the end of the same year, I created an Android app called <a
        href="https://cafebazaar.ir/app/ir.rezasoft.app">Iran's animals</a> and launched it on Cafe Bazar and Myket
        Market, which was about Iran's animals. After that, I began learning Python, gained experience with and used
        various <b>hacking</b> and security tools, and began learning penetration testing. I remained in this field for
        a while, learning various things. After that, I proceeded to WordPress website design and produced my first
        website, WordPress Magazine, which was about <b>WordPress</b> and related tutorials. For numerous years, I
        worked
        with WordPress. I enrolled at university, where they taught us <b>C++</b>. At the same time, I launched an
        Instagram community called
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barnamenevisiinsta">barnamenevisiinsta</a>, which grew to become one of the
        first and largest Persian communities of Iranian programmers, and I was providing programming material for it. I
        saw that it was my turn to create my own system, so I learned C# and created several Windows programs such as
        accounting applications, libraries, and calculators, and I started making games with unity and also created a 2D
        game, but the purpose of learning <b>C#</b> was to learn the <b>ASP.NET</b> Core framework, why?
        Because I had heard about establishing Stack Overflow using this framework, I learnt it and built a blog and an
        online store with it, but I couldn't interact with it for different reasons, and that was the end of my use of
        <b>ASP.NET</b> Core. I went to learn <b>Django</b>, and the process was and still is really enjoyable for me. I
        used <b>Django</b> to create a blog and eventually an online store. However, this was insufficient because <b>Django</b>
        was more capable. So, what exactly did I do? I used it to create a social network called <a
        href="https://github.com/rzashakeri/Happier">Happier</a>, however I discovered that there is a difficulty
        validating the files supplied by the user. The Happier project was put on hold, and I wrote a new library called
        <a href="https://github.com/rzashakeri/django-audio-validator">django audio validator</a> to handle the problem
        of validating files, but it had a major flaw: it only validated audio files. In this case, I
        wrote a new library called
        <a href="https://github.com/file-validator/file-validator">file validator</a>, which validated all types of
        files and was well-tested and documented. Meanwhile, there was a major
        issue
        with publishing my content to Instagram, and that was the presence of rigorous filtering in the Islamic
        Republic, which made it difficult to upload my posts to Instagram. I decided to create a Telegram bot to upload
        my posts to Instagram via Telegram, and the outcome was <a
        href="https://github.com/rzashakeri/Instagram-Assistant">Instagram-Assistant</a>. In addition to uploading, I
        added other nice features like a lottery between likes and post comments, downloading any form of Instagram
        media, obtaining post statistics, and so on.
        This story continues, and I am learning new things and teaching them to others because this is how we learn
        best. I am also a student of <b>computer engineering</b>.
